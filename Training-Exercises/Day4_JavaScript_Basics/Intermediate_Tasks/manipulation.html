    <h1 id="head">Global Warming</h1>
    <p>Global warming is the long-term warming of the planet’s overall temperature. Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, 
        its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels. As the human population has increased, 
        so has the volume of fossil fuels burned. Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas, and burning them causes what is known as the 
        “greenhouse effect” in Earth’s atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>The greenhouse effect is when the sun’s rays penetrate the atmosphere, but when that heat is reflected off the surface cannot escape back 
        into space. Gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels prevent the heat from leaving the atmosphere. These greenhouse gasses are carbon 
        dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, water vapor, methane, and nitrous oxide. The excess heat in the atmosphere has caused the average global 
        temperature to rise overtime, otherwise known as global warming.
    </p>
    <p>Global warming has presented another issue called climate change. Sometimes these phrases are used interchangeably, however, they are 
        different. Climate change refers to changes in weather patterns and growing seasons around the world. It also refers to sea level rise 
        caused by the expansion of warmer seas and melting ice sheets and glaciers. Global warming causes climate change, which poses a serious 
        threat to life on Earth in the forms of widespread flooding and extreme weather. Scientists continue to study global warming and its impact
        on Earth.

        <h2 class="subhead">Climate Change</h2>
        <p>Climate change presents a fundamental threat to human health. It affects the physical environment as well as all aspects of both natural 
        and human systems – including social and economic conditions and the functioning of health systems. It is therefore a threat multiplier, 
        undermining and potentially reversing decades of health progress. As climatic conditions change, more frequent and intensifying weather 
        and climate events are observed, including storms, extreme heat, floods, droughts and wildfires. These weather and climate hazards affect 
        health both directly and indirectly, increasing the risk of deaths, noncommunicable diseases, the emergence and spread of infectious 
        diseases, and health emergencies.
        </p>
        <p>Climate change is also having an impact on our health workforce and infrastructure, reducing capacity to provide universal health coverage 
        (UHC). More fundamentally, climate shocks and growing stresses such as changing temperature and precipitation patterns, drought, floods and
        rising sea levels degrade the environmental and social determinants of physical and mental health. All aspects of health are affected by 
        climate change, from clean air, water and soil to food systems and livelihoods. Further delay in tackling climate change will increase 
        health risks, undermine decades of improvements in global health, and contravene our collective commitments to ensure the human right to 
        health for all.
